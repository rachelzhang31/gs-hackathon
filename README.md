Welcome to COVID-19 Insights! We created this website to visualize the impact of COVID-19 on different sections of the US population with a special focus on unemployed and incarcerated individuals, who have been affected disproportionately by the pandemic. We also explored mobility trends over time. Our goal was to present this information in a digestible format for people of all ages and technical backgrounds. 

This is a React web app with a Firebase backend, and we used the Nivo module for data visualization. You can find our source code in the master branch and the production build in gh-pages. Our data is from Goldman Sachs' Marquee, the CDC, Google's Public Data Explorer, and the Marshall Project.
