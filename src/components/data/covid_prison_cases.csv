We've subtracted all presumptive positive cases for this 12/1 figure, which may be a slight overcount or undercount depending on the number of presumptive positive cases between 11/19-11/23 and between 12/1-12/10.

For prisoners: similar issues hold for calculating the right number of presumptive positive cases. Our figure reflects 574 cases among residents and 49 cases among newly admitted residents who were infected prior to admission. We subtract 18 total presumptive positive cases from this figure."
